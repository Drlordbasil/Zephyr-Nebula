Here's a refactored version of the script with some further enhancements:

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import RequestException
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


def preprocess_data(data):
    return [item.text.strip() for item in data]


def tokenize_data(data):
    return [word_tokenize(item) for item in data]


def scrape_data(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception if the request was unsuccessful
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        data = soup.find_all('div', class_='item')
        cleaned_data = preprocess_data(data)
        tokenized_data = tokenize_data(cleaned_data)
        return tokenized_data
    except RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while scraping data: {e}")
        return None


def visualize_data(data):
    # Implement your specific data visualization logic here
    # You have access to the tokenized data as the 'data' parameter
    # Use the matplotlib library to create plots, charts, etc.


def analyze_data(data):
    # Implement your specific data analysis logic here
    # You have access to the tokenized data as the 'data' parameter
    # Perform calculations, calculations, etc.


def main(url):
    tokenized_data = scrape_data(url)
    if tokenized_data:
        visualize_data(tokenized_data)
        analyze_data(tokenized_data)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    url = 'https://example.com'
    main(url)
```

In this refactored version:
1. I added `response.raise_for_status()` after the HTTP request to raise an exception if the request was unsuccessful (e.g., if the URL is invalid or the server returns an error).
2. I removed the unnecessary import of `nltk` since it was not being used in the refactored code.
3. I removed the `pass` statements in the `visualize_data` and `analyze_data` functions, as they are no longer needed.
4. I moved the comment explaining the purpose of the `visualize_data` and `analyze_data` functions to the actual function definitions for clarity.

Remember to implement the specific functionality for data visualization and analysis in the `visualize_data` and `analyze_data` functions. Also, make sure to handle exceptions appropriately and customize the code according to your needs.
